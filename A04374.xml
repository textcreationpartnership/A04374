         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now, Right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for my part, as I, from my very ſoule, hate in my ſelfe, all hypocriſie, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conſcience, and in my Iudgement, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alſo in my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and indeauours, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the gayning of Chriſt, and my being found in his righteouſneſſe, (as in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)

before all worldly pompe, pride, pelfe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and preferment: So is it, and ſo hath it been my chiefe care, in my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, to preach Chriſt ſoundly to my hearers, and to plant in their hearts the true and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge of him, and that in all Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>To which end, I haue now lately (beſides other Arguments in hand) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched this inſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning <hi>The Chriſtians Apparelling by

Christ:</hi> wherein I haue indeauoured, firſt, by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,</hi> (after the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and true meaning of the words) to <hi>excite</hi> and ſtirre vp the <hi>Slothfull</hi> to put on Chriſt. Secondly, by laying downe <hi>Meanes,</hi> to <hi>direct,</hi> and (with Gods grace) the better to <hi>informe</hi> and <hi>inable</hi> the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>weake</hi> Chriſtian ſo to doe. Thirdly, and chiefely, by <hi>Markes,</hi> (becauſe all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without ſinceritie) to <hi>aſſure</hi> and <hi>certifie</hi> the godly Chriſtian of his happy eſtate in Chriſt, by

which <hi>trialls</hi> he may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee aſſured that his paines and labour in ſo weightie a buſineſſe, is not beſtowed in vaine; as alſo the hypocriſie of the vnſound may bee diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
            <p>Theſe my paines, I doubt not, but with Gods bleſsing, they by the eye may adde to the profit of thoſe who ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally were partakers of them by the eare; ſo they may bee vſefull alſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which is the end why I make them ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>

                  <p>It is impoſsible, if Chriſt bee once ours and wee his; if once we be eſpouſed to him and haue put him on, but that wee ſhould much deſire to heare his voice and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his company, and reioyce therein.

But this holy ſpirit where it is begets the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary graces in good meaſure, and makes vs who were <hi>proud,</hi> truly <hi>humble,</hi> and not only vpon by reſpects to ſuppreſſe Pride, but inwardly and ſincerely to <hi>loue humilitie,</hi> euen for it ſelfe; ſo it makes vs of <hi>angry, meeke;</hi> of <hi>malicious, louing;</hi> of <hi>vncleane, chaſt;</hi> of <hi>couetous, liberall;</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,</hi> truly <hi>religious;</hi> not vpon ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter grounds and motiues, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

                  <p>Therefore to proceede: Hauing propounded formerly to giue ſome <hi>trialls of Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp; that in the firſt place, from the <hi>nature</hi> of our putting on Chriſt, which wee made to conſiſt, 1.

as it is with the godly mans both ſorrow and ioy: they are all for <hi>Ioy</hi> and rauiſhments, nothing for ſorrow at all, neither before, nor after their pretended conuerſion, and therefore their ioy, which ſhould haue begunne with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ends with ſorrow: before that harueſt of Ioy (which in this life is <hi>only ſowne for the righteous and vpright in heart</hi>) doe come, all is withered, and they become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitefull.

As thoſe that worke in waxe, cannot frame any new impreſsion in it, till the olde be defaced: ſo muſt the image of the deuill bee firſt defaced, before Chriſt Ieſus and his image can be formed in vs. Sound Chriſtians haue Chriſt ſealed and ſtamped on their ſoules, and they weare him alſo as their vpper garments in a holy profeſsion: ſo that he is ſeene euen in their attire, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not vaine, in their ſpeech which is graceful, not (vſually) idle, vaine or impertinent, in their behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and in all the actions of their life; yet ſo, as that they weare no other garment, either vnder him
